##JavaScript as Data Processing Language at Qcon London 2013

The talk is about new data management challenges and how it can be solve by changing the stack and the meaning of starage system. NoSQL and map/reduce introduce lots of change in data storage/management area breaking the ACID plain old way of thinking. This is why we need new way to process data, because SQL don't solve all the cases. Slides are on slideshare and [there is the video of the talk](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/javascript-data-processing-html5).
